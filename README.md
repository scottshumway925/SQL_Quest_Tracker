This software is a sql database and a C# console app that allows for users to keep track of quests and rewards for all their quests. You can perform all the major CRUD operations using the frontend.


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. You will need to have Visual Studio installed with the .net8 framework brought into it to run.
2. Build the files as you normally would a console app, and voila, you've got yourself a running up.
3.

It's a simple console app. Follow the prompts, and you will be able to use the software just fine.

## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Visual Studio with the .net8 framework installed into it.
* SSMS, or Microsoft's SQL server. Take the .sql file in the repository and run it in SSMS.
* Change the connection string in the code to match your local server. It is currently set to connect to THEHIVEMIND server.
